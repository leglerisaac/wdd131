			<h3>Workout Tracker</h3>
			<p>
				The Workout Tracker wireframe shows the main interface where users can log their workouts. The layout includes a section for entering exercises, sets, reps, and weights, as well as a button to complete the workout once at least one exercise has been added. What is not shown is the workout report that will be shown once the workout is completed, which will display an overview of the workout and some statistics. 				Workout tracker pulls exercise information from this open source, "Unlicense" database of exercises: <a href="https://github.com/yuhonas/free-exercise-db">https://github.com/yuhonas/free-exercise-db</a>
			</p>

			<h3>Exercise Finder</h3>
			<p>
				Exercise finder allows the user to search for and filter exercises using attributes of the exercises. Not shown in the wireframe is the actual content of the exercise cards. Each card will contain the name of the exercise, a brief description, and an image or icon representing the exercise. Exercise finder pulls exercise information from the same database as the workout tracker.
